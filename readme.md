//Mi Cocina

Using the Edamam API for Recipe Search, a user on the Mi Cocina App is able to create an account, and once logged into their account, they can look up recipes and add their favorite ones to a favorites list.

Since recipes vary so much, the approach I needed to take in order to display consistent data to the user was to only display four things that every recipe had: title, image, serving size, and a clickable link that takes the user to page where the full recipe is displayed.

There are not any unsolved problems to the app.
